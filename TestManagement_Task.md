## Block 1: Test Strategy

    1.1 What will be the most important aspects of your testing strategy?
        1. Project Scope and Overview
        2. Test Approach, which specifies the level of testing required, as well as the test environment and process.For example, unit tests, E2E tests, and integration tests.
        3. Tool Stack: Identifying Test Tools for Test Executiontest management, automation, and performance tools required for testing.
        4. Risk Analysis: Provide a clear plan to test the risks and impacts on AUT.
        5. Review and approvals for signing off on changes to the next steps in the release


    1.2 What are the main testing challenges in this project?
        1. Team Collaboration: As product teams are cross-functional teams with a focus on different topics,
        2. Diversity in Testing Environments and Platforms

    1.3 How would you approach the test automation strategy in this project?
        1. The project has multiple platforms focusing on backend and front-end topics.
            1.1 My first priority would be to automate the regression suite, which would run after each deployment. saves effort and also helps in finding bugs that were introduced with deployment.
        2. API focused test automation suite and UI focused test automation suite to test APIs.Running component-level test cases on every MR to find bugs early before merging.
        3. High-level E2E test cases that cover the essential end-user functionalities
        4. Non-functional testing involving the use of performance tools to evaluate an application's performance with multiple concurrent users.


    1.4 How would you approach the integration of automated tests into the project's CI/CD pipelines?
        1. Automation suites that are installed on every MR.
            1.1 Install Environment->Deploy Changes->Execute Tests->Report Results->Clean environment
        2. Integrate the regression test suite into the release deployment pipeline. execute them once the release candidate is deployed.


## Block 2: Methodology

    2.1 Which methodologies would you recommend for project development?
        I recommend the Agile methodology with Scrum as a process.
    
    2.2 Why?
        1. Agile Scrum is an iterative methodology with a specific duration of time period. 
        2. The Scrum team works together to build a solution. 
        3. Continuous development and testing
        4. Testing features in each iteration will help in catching bugs early.
        5. It helps in building a product within a specified timeline with good quality.

## Block 3: Test team

    3.1 How would you configure the test team for this project?
        1. Architecturally, the project has FE and BE platforms involved.
        2. I would configure a test team with a couple of members with the main focus on both manual and automation testing and working in Agile product teams.
            2.1. Tester One should have prior experience with front-end testing tools such as Cypress and Selenium.
            2.2. Tester Two should have experience in back-end testing using tools like RestAssured or Postman.


    3.2 What skills do you believe are essential for your team members to have?
        1. SDLC and domain knowledge
        2. Working as a member of a product team that employs Scrum as a methodology
        3. Several years' of industry experience


    3.3 Which mindset and attitude would you look for in your team?
        1. An open and optimistic attitude toward team situations
        2. Trust and cooperation
        3. Resiliency and self-sufficiency

## Block 4: Test Process
    4.1 How would you identify the test scenarios and test cases needed?
        1. Recognize the functional work flow and imagine potential users and usage scenarios for the application.
        2. The scenarios should cover the end-to-end functionality of the application and all its business flows.
        3. The identified scenarios should be independent of the other test scenarios.
        4. Ensure that every identified scenario is a story in its own right.
        5. Test scenarios must cover the negative and out-of-the-box testing with a "Test to Break" attitude.
        6. Domain knowledge is important to get a deeper understanding of the application.
        7. All scenarios should be linked to the application's requirements document or user stories.
        8. Test scenarios should be reviewed by the product manager, business analyst, or anyone else who understands the requirements really well.


    4.2 How would you keep the traceability between test cases, scenarios, and requirements?
        1. would create a Requirement Tracebility Matrix (RTM) to verify that all the requirements are covered in testing.


    4.3 How would you split the testing responsibilities between developers and testers?
        1. The developer will execute white box tests like unit tests and also define the impact analysis.
        2. The tester will be responsible for preparing test analysis, test scenarios, test execution, bug reporting, and test reports.
        3. Split is done after knowing the architecture and functional requirements of the project.
        4. For example, I will create a product team with a focus on the front end, back end, and integration.

 ## Block 5: Tools
    5.1 What tools do you use to manage tests?
        1. I would use Jira as a test management tool for creating test cases, test executions, test reports, and bug reporting.
        2. Jira Dashboards for defect analysis and test execution reports.
    
    5.2 Which tools do you use for performance testing?
        1. For performance testing, I would recommend the Jmeter Apache tool.
        2. It has the advantage of being open source and having widespread support.
        3. Tool installation and maintenance is light and robust. 
    
    5.3 Which tools/frameworks would you use for API testing and API automation?
        1. I would use the Postman tool to run manual API tests.
        2. For Automation,
             2.1. RestAssured API test using Selenium Java depending on the development stack.
             2.2. Cypress tool for API testing only if we have an FE automation suite with Cypress. This is because, keeping maintenance in mind, using multiple tools requires more maintenance, like version updates, different code bases, etc.
        3. For frameworks,
             3.1. Serenity BDD using Gherkin, which has good maintainability, readability, and reports.


    5.4 Which tools/frameworks would you use for FE testing and FE Automation?
        1. Cypress as FE automation tools for automation which has good sync, maintainability, time travel, and documentation.
        2. For frameworks,
             2.1 Design Pattern with BDD: Page Object Model, which has good reusability and maintainability. 5.5:


    5.5 Which other tools would you use?
        1. Intellij as an IDE, which has a good interface compared to other tools.
        2. Jenkins as CI/CD
        3. Static Code Analysis with SonarQube
        4. Jmeter is used for performance testing.
